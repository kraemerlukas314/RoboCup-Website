		A friend of mine and I (Lukas) founded the team "Schokobrötchen" in 2017. Our first RoboCup Season was in 2018, where we finished 6th in the qualification for the German Opens in St. Augustin. In 2019, we renamed our team to "Freewin 2.0" and secured the 9th place in St. Augustin. We once more renamed our team to "πthon πraten" in 2020, and this time, we successfully qualified for the actual German Opens with our robot. However, the German Opens were canceled due to the corona pandemic.
		<br>
		During the next RoboCup season in 2021, we participated in the online World Cup, and we were among the last six teams (final scores were never revealed). One year later, we merged two teams, which resulted in a third team member who had been participating in RoboCup since 2016 and is now responsible for the software development of our robot. Furthermore, we decided to mark the start of a new era with another team name, so "BitFlip" was born.
		<br>
		We successfully qualified for the German Opens in 2022, where we finished in 3rd place. As a result, we were allowed to participate in the European Competition in Portugal, where we managed to secure 2nd place. In 2023, we achieved even greater success by winning the German Opens, and we also obtained 6th place at the World Cup in France.
		<br>
		<br>
		Needless to say, we are incredibly excited for season 2024!
